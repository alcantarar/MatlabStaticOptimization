# Static Optimization in Matlab
This code solves the muscle redundancy problem using static optimization in Matlab, providing flexible cost and constraint functions in Matlab. Details about the implementation can be found in Uhlrich et al., 2020. TODO: add citation

## Running example code
Clone the repository and use the MAIN_StaticOptimization.m script to run the code.
